### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. **Persona:**
    A lecturer from the Department of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Wisconsin-Madison needs an interactive map about the HIV in the United States. The course that this lecturer is teaching is a junior level course that faces to the general public. It introduces the history of each disease, and educates students to prevent from getting affected by the major epidemic diseases like AIDS, chicken pox, etc. To introduce the HIV topic, the lecturer needs to visualize the HIV cases (and rates) in each state through years. In this way, students will get a rough idea of how HIV have been changing in each state, how effective the local government's policy prevented people from getting the disease, and hopefully some pattern or trend that can lead students to discover other causes of getting AIDS. The lecturer also wants to compare and visualize the HIV diifference between gender, age, and race, because the lecturer tries to guide students to find potential factors that might influence the HIV affection. 
    2. **Scenario:**
    Upon arriving at this interactive HIV map, the lecturer is greeted with a state-level overview using proportional circle symbols to depict the diagnosis rates of each state. The center of the circle symbol is placed on the centroid of each state. Then she can move the button on the slider (or click the "next year/last year" button) to demonstrate how the HIV spreaded out from 2015 to 2019. Students would be able to identify the states that have the most severe HIV affection (rank the states based on the infection). The lecturer can also filter the results on the map by selecting what gender/age group/races. This is to compare the results and visualize the difference. This is to inspire students to identify potential factors that might have an influence on the HIV spread-out.
