### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. **Target User Profile (Persona):**
    Name & Position: Evelyn Wang, an international student who is currently studying the international law at the New York University
    Background Description: Evelyn was born in China and came to New York City to pursue her graduate studies at the law school of New York University. On a winter         night, Evenlyn took the last train home from school. When the subway stopped at the time square station, a guy entered the train. As it was very late at night, the     train was full of empty seats, and Evelyn was the only passenger at that moment. The door closed. That guy went straight to the seat right next to Evelyn, sat         down, and stared at Evelyn. Evelyn immediately got uncomfortable and alarmed, and switched to another seat. However, that guy shadowed Evelyn and sat down next to     her again. Evelyn was very frightened but there was no one on the train she could ask for help. The door eventually opened, and Evelyn ran out of that train           immediately. 

    This is the first time that Evelyn experienced such a crime and she clearly realized that she is not the only Asian who suffered from this. She read news almost       every week about how Asian people got sexually assulted, robbed, or even shooted, and such situation is getting worse after the Covid-19 breakout. Evelyn believes     in justice and dignity as a young lawyer, and her social responsibility motivates her to equip herself with more Asian hate crime knowledge, so that she can           protect herself and prevent more Asian people from getting attacked. As a result, Evelyn needs an app that can identify the place and time that Asian crime             frequently happens if she filters the type of crime and/or a census block group. She also hopes this app can detect any potential patterns exhibited among these       dangerous areas and the trends across multiple years in these areas. It would be even helpful if this app can rank these areas from most dangerous to least             dangerous, so she can select a path that is safer. 

    2. **User Case Scenario:**
    #1: Upon arrival at the interactive, the user is welcomed by a pop-up window describing the purpose of this app as well as a series of photos to a user onboarding         tutorial. The user can "go the map". Then, the user will see a basemap of New York City. On the left side panel, the user will see a list of drop down menus. The user can filter conditions by clicking each drop down menu, checking the boxes to select the type of map/type of crime, moving the slider(sequence) to see the trend through multiple years/months. This interactive scenario shows how to narrow down the data and identify the census block groups where Asian crime frequently happens. This interaction also automatically ranks the census block groups based on the total number of the specified type of crime: it  visualizes this rank in a choropleth map and can be reexpressed as a bar chart. The user can zoom in (use the “+/-” buttons on the right top corner of the map) /pan around to see the area of interest in the choropleth map. The user can also resymbolize the choropleth map by changing the classification /color scheme directly in the legend.

    #2: After the choropleth map has been overlaid on the basemap, the user can hover on an area of interest (a specific census block group) and retrieve the crime         information about this area. The retrieved information will appear on a pop up window. The user can hold the ctrl key and select multiple census block groups.         These selected polygons would then be reexpressed as columns in a  table for the user to compare the crime statistics and maybe find a certain census block group       is an outlier. Eventually, the user can click the “Download” button on the bottom of the left side panel to download the map/table. The user would be asked to         select the format of the output (.png, .jpeg, etc.)
